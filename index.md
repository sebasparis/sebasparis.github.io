I am a MSc in Physics born in San Juan, Argentina. I am passionate about solving hard problems.

Some of my areas of interest are machine learning algorithms, quantum information theory, geophysics, and anything that involves challenging mathematical thinking.

This is my portfolio website where you can take a look at my [technical profile](www.sebasparis.com/profile), see my scientific [publications](www.sebasparis.com/publications) and check out some of my public [projects](www.sebasparis.com/projects).
